# ðŸ“Š Monitoring Exam Slot Utilization

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
The goal of this project was to create a solution for **monitoring the utilization of exam slots** in the system.  
The challenge was that an **exam slot was not linked to a specific subject** â€“ instead, it was shared across all subjects and levels for which a teacher had examination rights.  

As a result, in order to realistically track exam occupancy, it was necessary to build logic that assigns slots to subjects and education levels.

## ðŸ›  Data Challenges
1. **No unique slot definition per subject** â€“ a slot could potentially be available for multiple subjects and levels.  
2. **Information split across two tables**:  
   - the `calendar_event` table contains general information about added slots (slot type, recurrence),  
   - the `event_term` table stores detailed data about each specific exam slot instance.  
3. The need to distinguish between:  
   - **shared slots** (available slots),  
   - **booked slots** (already taken),  
   - **free slots** (available but not booked).

## âœ… Proposed Solution
The query was built using **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** to split the logic into clear steps:  

1. **booked_list** â€“ list of all booked slots (students assigned to terms).  
2. **shared_list** â€“ list of all slots shared by examiners.  
3. **booked** â€“ aggregated count of booked slots per subject and level.  
4. **shared** â€“ aggregated count of shared slots and calculation of free slots.  
5. **final select** â€“ `full join` of both aggregates to produce a complete view.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- **`slots.sql`** â†’ full SQL query
- **`README.md`** â†’ project description 
- **`example_output.jpg`** â†’ sample output of the query

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Outcome
The query allows to:  
- identify overall exam slot utilization,  
- quickly check the number of available free slots,  
- control exam availability per subject and level,  
- support exam planning and teacher resource management.
